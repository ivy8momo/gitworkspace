Well to my disappointment I got in the mail a small square about 4 inches around. And to add more disappointment when I built it it was smaller than the palm of my hand. For the price it should of been much much larger. Don't be fooled. It's only worth $5.00.Update 4/15/2013I have bought and completed 13 of these MODELS from A.C. Moore for $5.99 a piece, so i stand by my comment that thiss one is overpriced. It was still fun to build just like all the others from the maker of this brand.Just be warned, They are small.\"\n",

Having a special child of my own I could relate to the teacher and her madcap class. I've also spent time in similar classrooms and enjoyed the uniqueness of each and every child. Her story drew me into their world and had me laughing so hard my family thought I had lost my mind, so I shared the passage so they could laugh with me. Read this book if you enjoy a book with strong women, you won't regret it.\"\n",
